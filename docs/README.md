## Timeline (product) docs

This folder captures product intent and decisions before implementation.

### Start here

- `vision.md`: mission, thesis, audience, and guiding principles
- `product-requirements.md`: core concepts and requirements (v0)
- `mvp.md`: MVP scope, out-of-scope, and success metrics
- `ux-notes.md`: UX ideas for zoomable timelines + contribution flows
- `trust-safety.md`: sourcing, moderation, and integrity model (v0)
- `governance.md`: roles, claiming/merging duplicates, and curation rules (v0)
- `policy.md`: content policy and enforcement actions (v0)
- `glossary.md`: shared vocabulary

### How we use these docs

- Treat these as living documents.
- Prefer writing down trade-offs and non-goals explicitly.
- When we start building, we’ll link PRs/commits back to the relevant doc sections.
