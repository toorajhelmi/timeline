## Content policy (v0)

This is a minimal policy to ship an alpha/MVP responsibly. It will evolve.

### Prohibited content

- **Doxxing / personal data**: addresses, phone numbers, private IDs, workplace details for private individuals, or instructions to find them.
- **Threats and incitement**: credible threats, calls for violence, or instructions for harm.
- **Harassment**: targeted harassment, stalking, coordinated dogpiling, slurs directed at protected classes.
- **Hate**: content that dehumanizes or advocates discrimination/violence toward protected classes.
- **Sexual exploitation**: any CSAM or non-consensual sexual content (immediate escalation).
- **Impersonation**: pretending to be someone else in a misleading way.
- **Fraud / malware**: phishing links, scams, or malicious instructions.

### Restricted content (may be allowed with safeguards)

- **Graphic media**: allowed only with warnings and clear labeling; may be removed depending on severity.
- **Sensitive personal events**: deaths, injuries, and medical info of private individuals require strong public-interest justification and careful sourcing.

### Misinformation / propaganda approach

We do not promise perfect truth. We aim for **transparent provenance** and **navigable disagreement**:

- Claims should be **source-backed** wherever possible.
- Unsourced claims should be labeled and downranked in defaults (later).
- Contradictions should be represented as **disputes**, not flame wars.

### Enforcement actions

- Remove/hide content
- Lock discussions
- Rate-limit users/timelines
- Temporary or permanent bans
- Escalation for legal/CSAM/threats

### Appeals

For MVP: email-based appeal process (documented later).
