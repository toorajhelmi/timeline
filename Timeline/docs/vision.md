## Vision

### Mission

Build a shared, public-first way to **collectively document what happened over time** by assembling community contributions into **navigable timelines** that can span months to years.

### Thesis

Most social media optimizes for attention in the present moment. A timeline-centric model can optimize for:

- long-term memory
- context and chronology
- evidence and provenance
- corrections over time (history as a process)

### Who it’s for (initially)

- people following a long-running event or movement
- people contributing sources, first-hand observations, and context
- readers trying to understand “what happened, when, and why it matters”

### What success looks like

- a timeline becomes the “default reference” for a topic because it stays readable as it grows
- the system makes it easy to find key moments at any zoom level (day/week/month/year)
- corrections and disputes are visible and handled without destroying usability

### Guiding principles

- **Chronology over feed**: time is the primary organizing axis.
- **Structured entries**: not everything is a “post”; we distinguish updates, evidence, claims, analysis, and corrections.
- **Provenance first**: show where information came from and how it evolved.
- **Transparency**: immutable edit history and clear labeling (human vs AI, opinion vs claim).
- **Safety by design**: harassment/doxxing/brigading mitigation is a first-class product requirement.
